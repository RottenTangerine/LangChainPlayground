    "### Streaming full state\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about ways to [stream our graph state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#streaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "`.stream` and `.astream` are sync and async methods for streaming back results. \n",
    " \n",
    "LangGraph supports a few [different streaming modes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/stream-values/) for [graph state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/stream-values/):\n",
    " \n",
    "* `values`: This streams the full state of the graph after each node is called.\n",
    "* `updates`: This streams updates to the state of the graph after each node is called.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at `stream_mode=\"updates\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we stream with `updates`, we only see updates to the state after node in the graph is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `chunk` is a dict with `node_name` as the key and the updated state as the value."
